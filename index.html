<p>Welcome to our <b>Targeted Editing</b> series where today you can put on a sweater, or make <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> data better! (Both take about the same amount of time.)</p>

<ol style="list-style-type:disc">
        <li><b>How can building names be used?</b>
          <p></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Help with search.  Addresses are great, but a building name can take you a long way towards finding where you want to go.  Apartment complexes usually have names.  Office buildings sometimes have names.</li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Help with routing.  Routing and search often work together.  If you would like to find a route to a building, but you don&#39;t know the address, the name might help.</li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Help with labeling.  The more you zoom in, the more labels you might see, but not if the features don&#39;t have names.</li>  
            </ol>
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li><b>We are missing some building names here!</b>

            <p></p>
            <ul>
                <li>There are many different types of buildings, but check out this pie chart for residential &amp; apartment buildings in Hong Kong:</li>
                <div id="res_building_name_piechart" style="width: 900px; height: 500px;"></div>
                <li>Residential &amp; apartment building names are very common in Hong Kong.  Are they common where you live, too?</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li><b>How you can help improve buildings without names:</b>
            <p></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Here is a map styled by <a href="https://github.com/meetar">Peter Richardson</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/nvkelso">Nathaniel V. Kelso</a> showing many residential &amp; apartment buildings that don't have names.</li>
